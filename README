=======================
This Mercurial extension automates the actions required by the [Salsita worklow][workflow_diagram].

Installation
------------

1. Grab the sources from <https://dev.salsitasoft.com/rc/hgplugin> and put them somewhere where they can stay.

    (Elmo says: _Elmo would not save such files in, say, like "/tmp"_)

1. ##### IMPORTANT! (**Windows users only**)
    Edit the \_\_init\_\_.py file and delete the following line:

    `demandimport.disable()`

    TortoiseHg workbench (and/or some other extensions) will not work otherwise.

1. Install dependencies:

   ###### Mac OS & Linux.


        `pip install -r requirements.txt`

    If you want to run unit tests, you will also need:

        `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`

    (Elmo says: _If Elmo was not going to develop the plugin himself, he probably wouldn't install those._)

   ###### Windows


    If you are on Windows, it's not that simple. Here's what you do:

    (Please note that it's **REALLY IMPORTANT** that you install 64 bit ports of the SW if you're running a 64 bit Windows box. You might get all sorts of weird errors otherwise.)

    1. Install **Python 2.7** (from http://www.python.org/getit/).

    2. Install **setuptools** from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

    3. Add "C:\Python;C:\Python27\Scripts" (or wherever you installed your Python) to your PATH so that you can run `python` and other commands from anywhere.

        3b. Run `easy_install pip` to install **pip** (standard Python package manager).

    4. You will need to install **Mercurial**. It's important that you install the correct one. The one bundled with TortoiseHg cripples PYTHONPATH and thus makes the workflow plugin unusable.
        4a. If you have Mercurial installed, please uninstall it.

        4b. Download Mercurial from http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/Download/ You want the one that says "This is recommended for hgweb setups and extensions with non-standard dependencies."

        4c. Install Mercurial. If you want TortoiseHg, install it afterwards (just don't install the bundle first).

    5. Go to the directory where this file has been cloned to (i.e., the workflow plugin repository root).

    6. Install **plugin dependencies**. Run "pip install -r requirements.txt". It will most probably fail when installing lxml, because lxml is a pain to install using pip on Windows. However because lxml comes last in the requirements.txt file, the other dependencies should be installed.

    7. Download & install **lxml** binary from http://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml/2.3#downloads


1. Add this to your ${HOME}/.hgrc:

        [extensions]
        workflow = /Users/elmo/src/workflow_plugin/

        [workflow]
        token = <your PT token>

        [reviewboard]
        server = https://dev.salsitasoft.com/rb/
        user = <your RB username>

     to make Mercurial aware of the extension, set Pivotal Tracker & ReviewBoard auth info and set the ReviewBoard server URL.  

     __PT token__ can be found at the bottom of your Pivotal Tracker profile page (<https://www.pivotaltracker.com/profile>). You might need to generate the token first if you never used it.

1. Add the following to your project's .hg/hgrc file:

        [workflow]
        project_id = <Your PT project ID>

        [reviewboard]
        repoid = <Review Board project repository id>

    You can get the repoid by running the 'hg postreview' commands (if you have the post review extension installed). It will list your projects and their ids.

    You can copy the PT __project_id__ number from the URL when you go to the project's page (e.g. https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/**123456**). 


Usage
-----
Type `hg help workflow` to list the available commands and their usage.


.hgrc Options
-------------
`no_backup_files=True` â€¦ If set, no backup files are generated when using the "--clean" flag to revert uncommited changes (for any command that accepts the "--clean" flag). Don't set it if you want the backup files to be created (which is the default setting).
